# midix_synth

# Overview
This crate is **NOT READY** for use.

This crate has been published to park the name, and is under active development.

Most of this code, and the
respective challenges of implementation comes
DIRECTLY from [rustysynth v1.3.3](https://github.com/sinshu/rustysynth).

This crate refactors portions of `rustysynth` to operate cohesively with `bevy_midix`.

It should not be used *independently*. Thanks!!
